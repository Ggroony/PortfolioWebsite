HTML, CSS Front end Website Build

SO I am working on this as my first ever HTML/CSS build - it is a work in progress and I have a lot to learn regarding the whole process. 

I have a good general theme and idea; now I just want to figure out how to add this to a backend code (python) to make it a full stack project. 

Happy to get any feed back! Thank you!
